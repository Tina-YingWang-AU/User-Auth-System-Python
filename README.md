# \# User Authentication \& Management System (Python)

# 

# \## 📌 Project Overview

# This Python application was developed as a technical solution for \*\*Gelos Enterprises\*\*. It provides a secure and efficient way to manage user credentials, featuring a complete workflow for account registration, secure login, and administrative auditing.

# 

# \## 🚀 Core Functionalities

# \- \*\*User Registration:\*\* Implements input validation to ensure passwords meet security length requirements.

# \- \*\*Secure Authentication:\*\* Validates user credentials against a persistent text-based database (`accounts.txt`).

# \- \*\*Account Auditing:\*\* Allows administrators to view a numbered list of all registered usernames.

# \- \*\*Menu-Driven Interface:\*\* A user-friendly Command Line Interface (CLI) for seamless navigation between components.

# 

# \## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

# \- \*\*Data Persistence:\*\* Utilized Python's built-in File I/O to handle data storage and retrieval.

# \- \*\*Logic \& Validation:\*\* Employed robust conditional logic to handle authentication states and input errors.

# \- \*\*Clean Code:\*\* Structured with readability and modularity in mind, following standard Python naming conventions.

# 

# \## 📂 Project Structure

# \- `main.py`: The primary application script containing the logic for all three components.

# \- `accounts.txt`: The data file used for storing encrypted-style user credentials.

# \- `README.md`: Project documentation.
